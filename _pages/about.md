# About Me

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, USA under the advice of Dr. Aniruddha Datta. Before this, I completed my Master's and Bachelor's in Technology at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, India, specializing in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering. 

I have worked as a research engineer, including a stint as a NSF funded Research Engineer at Sumaq Life LLC in 2023 and a Deep Learning Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute, India in 2020. I attended University of Illinois and Stanford University in Summer 2019 as Exchange Visitor Student under the guidance of Prof. Idoia Ochoa.
